# Why Unv?
--
We can't use one langauge for everything. Unv is a attempt to make a simple one for this purpose.With simple syntax similar to python , it can be used for any task.
<br>
**It can be compiled to:**
- JS
- Python
- *More to come*
 <br>
**It can be used for:**
- Web
- IOT
- pretty much anything else
<br>
**Here's a taste of UNV :**
```
import 'print' from 'standard'
if 'Unv is awesome!'
    print('Hello World!')
```
Currently UNV is under development
