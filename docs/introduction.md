# Why Unv?
--
There are languages none we can use universally . Unv is a attempt to make a simple one for this purpose.With simple syntax similar to python , it can be used pretty pleasntly for anything.
**Here's a taste of UNV :**
```
import 'print' from 'standard'
if 'Unv is awesome!'
    print('Hello World!')
```
<!-- Not sure if the first line import print ect. is supposed to be there  it was there at one point in the playground. -->
