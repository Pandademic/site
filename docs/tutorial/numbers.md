# Numbers

Variables of numeric types are created when you assign a value to them:

**Integers**

```py
x =  1  
y =  35656222554887711  
z =  -3255522  
```

**Floating point numbers**

```py
x =  1.10  
y =  1.0  
z = -35.59  
```

Float can also be scientific numbers with an "e" to indicate the power of 10.

```py
x =  35e3  
y =  12e4  
z = -87.7e100  
```
